### SwiftfulCrypto

This is an iOS crypto tracking app created using SwiftUI and Clean Architecture. It was made by following @SwiftulThinking's course on YouTube. After completing the course, Core Data was integrated to implement an offline-first approach. Dependency Injection and unit tests were also added to make the codebase more maintainable.
